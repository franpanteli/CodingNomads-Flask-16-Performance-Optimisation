# CodingNomads-Flask-16-Performance-Optimisation
This repository contains my work for the 16th module in the Coding Nomads Flask course. I completed this as part of my independent learning, to invest in my Python skills. I produced an in-depth library of resources on this module, whose file tree is provided below.

I saved course material as pdf files (.pdf extensions) and made notes on these (Written Notes.txt). I made summary notes, by recording voice memos of Siri reading my notes out (Voiced Notes.mp4a) and creating word clouds out of them (Word Cloud.png). These word clouds were combined into a giff, to visually represent modules content.

Video notes were next made in a txt format, contained in [16.9 Videos](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-Flask-16-Performance-Optimisation/tree/main/16.9%20Videos). A [module quiz](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-Flask-16-Performance-Optimisation/blob/main/16.10%20Quizzes/16.10%20Quiz%20Representing%20Content.pdf) was finally completed and passed.
